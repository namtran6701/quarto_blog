Hello! I'm Nam Tran, and I welcome you to my website.

I'm an aspiring business analytics professional, born a nd raised in Vietnam. Ever since my introductory course to business analytics, I've been deeply passionate about harnessing the power of machine learning and AI to make informed business decisions and derive insights from data. This passion has not only guided my academic pursuits but also shaped my aspirations for the future.

I recently graduated from the State Universit y of New York at New Paltz with a double major in Business Analytics and Finance. As the next step in my academic journey, I'm heading to North Carolina to pursue a Master's degree in Business Analytics from Wake Forest University.

I'm a strong believer in the transformative power of Artificial Intelligence. I envision a future where innovation is driven by the synergy between human and machine intelligence, ultimately leading to a better world. This philosophy is a driving force in my academic endeavors and future career aspirations in the business analytics field.

When I'm not immersed in studying or exploring new AI technologies, you'll often find me cheering for my favorite soccer club, Arsenal, or out in the great outdoors. I'm a huge fan of active pursuits such as hiking, running, and camping. These hobbies not only provide a counterbalance to my intense academic focus but also offer me a refreshing change of scenery, invigorating my mind and keeping me connected with nature.

Here on my website, I share insights and ideas about business analytics, machine learning, AI, and my academic journey. I hope to inspire and connect with like-minded individuals or those interested in the transformative potential of business analytics and AI.

For inquiries or collaboration, please feel free to contact me at [**namtran6701\@gmail.com**](mailto:namtran6701@gmail.com).

Thank you for visiting my site. I'm thrilled to share my journey with you and looking forward to the opportunity of working together!
